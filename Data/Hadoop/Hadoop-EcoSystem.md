### **Hadoop Ecosystem Overview**

#### **Hadoop Core Components**

1. **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**

   **Definition**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to store and manage vast amounts of data across multiple machines. It is highly fault-tolerant and designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Blocks**: HDFS stores files as blocks of data. Each block is typically 128 MB or 256 MB in size. Large files are split into smaller blocks and distributed across the cluster.
   - **Replication**: Each block is replicated across multiple nodes (default replication factor is 3) to ensure fault tolerance and data durability.
   - **NameNode**: Manages the metadata of the file system, including the file-to-block mapping and the block locations. It does not store actual data but rather the metadata.
   - **DataNode**: Stores the actual data blocks and serves read and write requests from the clients. It periodically reports the status of its blocks to the NameNode.
   - **Secondary NameNode**: Provides a backup of the NameNode's metadata and performs periodic checkpoints to keep the metadata up-to-date.

2. **MapReduce**

   **Definition**: MapReduce is a programming model for processing and generating large datasets with a parallel, distributed algorithm. It divides the data processing task into two phases: Map and Reduce.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Map Phase**: The input data is divided into chunks, and each chunk is processed by the Mapper. Mappers perform filtering and sorting, producing intermediate key-value pairs.
   - **Shuffle and Sort**: The intermediate key-value pairs are shuffled and sorted based on the keys. This step groups all values associated with the same key together.
   - **Reduce Phase**: Reducers process the grouped data, aggregating and summarizing the results to produce the final output.

#### **Hadoop Ecosystem Tools**

1. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**

   **Definition**: YARN is a resource management layer that handles the scheduling of resources and management of job execution within the Hadoop ecosystem.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **ResourceManager**: Manages the allocation of resources across the cluster and schedules jobs. It ensures that resources are efficiently utilized.
   - **NodeManager**: Monitors the resource usage on each node and manages task execution. It reports resource usage and health status to the ResourceManager.
   - **ApplicationMaster**: Manages the lifecycle of applications and requests resources from the ResourceManager.

2. **Hive**

   **Definition**: Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-like query language for Hadoop that allows users to query and analyze data stored in HDFS using a familiar SQL-like syntax.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Metastore**: A repository for metadata about tables, partitions, and schemas. It stores information about the structure of the data.
   - **QL (Hive Query Language)**: A SQL-like query language used to perform queries, aggregations, and data transformations.
   - **Tables and Partitions**: Data is organized into tables and partitions. Partitioning helps in managing large datasets and improving query performance.

3. **Pig**

   **Definition**: Pig is a high-level scripting language for data flow and processing on Hadoop. It simplifies complex data transformations and processing tasks.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Pig Latin**: The language used to write Pig scripts. It provides a simple syntax for data manipulation and transformation.
   - **Grunt Shell**: An interactive shell used for executing Pig Latin commands and scripts.
   - **Data Flow**: Pig scripts describe the sequence of data transformations and processing steps, making it easier to develop complex data workflows.

4. **HBase**

   **Definition**: HBase is a distributed, scalable NoSQL database that runs on top of HDFS. It provides real-time read/write access to large datasets.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Tables**: Data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Tables are sparsely populated and can store a large amount of data.
   - **Column Families**: Columns are grouped into column families, which are stored together on disk for efficient access.
   - **RegionServers**: Manage the data for a set of regions (table splits) and handle read and write requests.

5. **Sqoop**

   **Definition**: Sqoop is a tool designed for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases. It supports import and export operations.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Import**: Loads data from relational databases into Hadoop (HDFS, Hive, or HBase). It supports parallel data transfer and can handle large volumes of data.
   - **Export**: Writes data from Hadoop (HDFS, Hive, or HBase) back into relational databases. It supports data transfer in parallel and can handle large datasets.

6. **Flume**

   **Definition**: Flume is a distributed service for collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data and other types of data into HDFS.

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Sources**: Components that ingest data from various sources, such as log files or network sockets.
   - **Channels**: Buffers that temporarily hold data between sources and sinks.
   - **Sinks**: Components that write data to HDFS or other storage systems.
