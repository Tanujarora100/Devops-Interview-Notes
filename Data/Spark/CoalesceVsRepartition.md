Both coalesce and repartition are functions used in PySpark to adjust the number of partitions in a DataFrame or RDD, but they differ in their capabilities and efficiency:
### Issue
If the partition size is uneven the executors will be idle when one executor will still be working.
Happens when we use a wide transformation=> data skewness and bigger partitions of keys in one partition.

### Repartition:
- Purpose: Can be used to increase or decrease the number of partitions in a DataFrame or RDD.expand_more
	- If we try to make more number of partitions then the data then it will place null values if the data is more.
- Operation: ==Shuffles data across the cluster to redistribute it into the desired number of partitions of even size. 
	- This can be an expensive operation, especially when increasing partitions.expand_more==
	- Skewness khatam kar dega and even sized partitions dega.
- Benefits:
	- Ensures a balanced workload across partitions, especially when the original partitioning scheme is uneven.
- Drawbacks:
	- Shuffling data can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### Coalesce:
1. Target Number of Partitions: You specify the desired number of partitions (less than the current number).
	1. Partitions merge karte time yaad rakhta hai ki same executor vale hi merge hote hai most of the time.
2. Merging Partitions: Coalesce attempts to merge existing partitions to reach the target number. ==This merging happens primarily within the same executor or node, minimising data shuffling across the network.==
3. If the target number is close to the original number of partitions, merging can be efficient with minimal shuffling.
	1. 200 MB/4=> 50 MB PARTITIONS 
4. For larger reductions, some shuffling might be involved, potentially leading to slight data imbalance.

#### Benefits:
- Efficiency: Coalesce prioritises minimal data shuffling compared to repartition, which can be resource-intensive, especially for large datasets. This makes it ideal for scenarios where reducing partitions is the primary goal and perfect balance isn't critical.
- Decreasing Partitions: It's specifically designed to reduce the number of partitions, unlike repartition which can also increase them.
- Simpler Logic: Compared to custom logic for merging partitions, coalesce offers a more concise approach.
### Cons:
- Uneven Data Distribution as it tries to merge the partitions on the same executor while repartition uses hash based shuffling so it has more even data.

#### Choosing Between repartition and coalesce:

- Use repartition when you need to both increase or decrease the number of partitions, or when you require a guaranteed balanced distribution across partitions.
- Use ==coalesce when you want to reduce the number of partitions and prioritise efficiency over perfect balance. ==It's ideal for scenarios where minimal shuffling is necessary.expand_more

#### Additional Considerations:
- The number of available executors in your Spark cluster can affect the behavior of coalesce. If the target number of partitions is less than the number of executors, coalesce might not fully utilize the cluster.
- In Spark 3.0 and above, the Adaptive Query Engine (AQL) can automatically adjust partitioning for some operations, potentially reducing the need for manual repartitioning.

#### Minimising Data Shuffling with Coalesce:
Here's why coalesce minimizes data shuffling compared to repartition:
1. Targeted Merging: ==Coalesce focuses on merging adjacent partitions within the same executor. This avoids sending data across the network,== which is a major bottleneck in distributed processing.
2. Locality Awareness: Coalesce leverages Spark's locality awareness. ==It attempts to merge partitions that are already stored on the same node, further reducing the need for data movement.==
Minimal Shuffling: As long as the target number of partitions is reasonably close to the original number, coalesce can merge partitions efficiently without significant shuffling.**
