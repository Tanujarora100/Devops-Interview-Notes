Data skewness in Spark occurs when a small number of values dominate a particular column used for partitioning or joining. 
	This can lead to uneven workloads across executors, where some executors handle a disproportionately large amount of data compared to others. 
	This can significantly impact the performance of your Spark application.

Here are several techniques to handle data skewness in Spark:

1. **Repartitioning:** You can explicitly repartition your DataFrame or Dataset to distribute the data more evenly across partitions. 
	1. This can be done using the `repartition()` function, specifying the desired number of partitions. Consider the distribution of your data when choosing the number of partitions.
2. **Custom Partitioning:** If the default hash-based partitioning doesn't work well for your skewed data, you can implement a custom partitioning strategy. 
	3. This strategy could involve using a different partitioning function or partitioning based on multiple columns.
3. **Bucketing:** In Spark SQL, bucketing allows you to group rows with the same value for a specific column (the bucketing column) into a predefined number of buckets.
	1. This can help distribute skewed data more evenly across partitions, improving join performance.
4. **Salting (Pre-Spark 3):** While not recommended for most modern Spark versions due to the introduction of Adaptive Query Execution (AQE), salting was a technique used before Spark 3 to address skewness. It involves adding a random value ("salt") to the join keys before partitioning. This randomizes the distribution of join keys and helps prevent all rows with the same key from ending up in the same partition.
