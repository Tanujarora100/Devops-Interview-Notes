### The Problem

Nowadays, most organizations are adapting to Data Driven Decision Making (DDDM) approach for decision-making. They are spending millions to interpret the data that is ubiquitously available around the organization sphere.

There are many solutions available for big data processing; out of all these solutions, Apache Spark (released in May 2014) became very popular in a short period of time. It is very fast, flexible, and developer-friendly, which were the reasons for its popularity.

Organizations started configuring their own on-premise dedicated clusters to process their big data workloads using Apache Spark. But the main difficulties with this setup was infra scalability, maintenance, and security.

As we know, managing organisational data never comes easy because data grows rapidly and scales frequently. And data centers were facing challenges with regard to maintenance, security as well as scalability.

In recent years, organizations started moving to cloud, as cloud technology became popular and more reliable. Cloud technology gives rise to many SaaS products pertaining to big data.

### The Solution

Among all these products, Databricks is the industry leading cloud data platform for big data processing and machine learning.

==Databricks is an Apache Spark based cloud unified analytics platform that can perform large-scale big data processing and machine learning workloads with ease. Databricks was started in the year 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark==

Databricks provides a user-friendly programmable and interactive notebook environment where Data Engineers/Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Scientists can work collaboratively as the platform supports R, Python, SQL, and Scala languages.

Databricks notebooks are so flexible that they can have code, documentation/text, data visualization in real time, and so on at one place. These notebooks can also be version controlled. All the code will be executed on Databricks spark clusters

### What can we do with Databricks?

- ==**As a Data Engineer:** We can build data lakes/data warehouses and perform data processing at scale. For example, Data Engineers read data from adls in databricks, apply transformation logic with a notebook, and output as new file to adls.==
- **As a Data Analyst:** We can perform analytics and visualisation for business decisions over the data at scale. For example, data analysts can create visualisation reports on the top of a data lake prepared by the data engineers.  
    **As a Data Scientist/ML Engineer**: We can build machine learning/deep learning pipelines and process petabytes of data for predictive analytics. For example, data scientists can build machine learning models to predict business insights, and so on.

Databricks is integrated with AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud providers, so it can  
be used within these cloud providers as a service (or) it is also available as a  
standalone cloud solution.
