**Linked Services:**

- **Function:** Act as connection managers that define how ADF interacts with external data sources.
- **Configuration:** You specify connection details like server names, usernames, passwords, or access keys specific to each data source
    - (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, SQL Database, Dynamics 365).
- **Benefits:**
    - **Centralised Management:** Configure connections once in the Linked Service and reuse them across different datasets and activities in your pipeline.
    - **Security:** Store sensitive connection information securely within ADF, avoiding hardcoding credentials in your pipelines.

**Datasets:**

- **Function:** Represent the specific data you want to use within your pipeline activities.
- **Definition:** You reference a Linked Service to establish the connection and then specify details about the data itself, such as:
    - **Data location:** Specify the container, folder, file path, or table name within the connected data source.
    - **Data format:** Define the format of the data (e.g., CSV, Parquet, JSON) for proper interpretation by ADF activities.
    - **Schema (optional):** Optionally, you can define the schema (structure) of the data, especially for complex formats.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Data Abstraction:** Datasets provide a logical view of your data, decoupling the data source specifics from the pipeline logic.
    - **Reusability:** Datasets can be reused across different activities within the same pipeline or even referenced in other pipelines.
    - **Data Lineage:** Datasets help track data origin and flow within your data pipelines.
    
    ## What is a Binary Dataset
    
    In the context of Azure Data Factory (ADF), a binary dataset represents data that is stored in a binary format. This means the data is in a raw, unstructured format, such as images, videos, or any other file type that is not structured as rows and columns (like CSV or Excel files).
    
    1. **Unstructured Data Handling**: Binary datasets are used to handle unstructured data. 
        1. Examples include multimedia files, compressed files, and proprietary data formats.
    2. **File-Based Storage**: Typically, binary datasets point to files stored in file-based storage systems like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage.
    3. **Copy Activities**: In ADF, binary datasets are often used in copy activities where the goal is to transfer files as-is from a source to a destination.
        1. All files without creating a new data set for each type.
    4. **Pass-Through Mechanism**: Since binary datasets deal with raw data, they essentially pass the data through the pipeline without inspecting or transforming its content.
