**Types of Triggers in ADF:**

1. **Schedule Trigger:** It allows you to run a pipeline at specific intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. 
    1. You can define complex schedules with cron expression.

### Tumbling Trigger:

1. In Azure Data Factory (ADF), a tumbling window trigger is a specific type of trigger that fires data pipelines at periodic intervals based on a defined time window. 

**Functionality:**

- **Time-based Activation:** A tumbling window trigger initiates a pipeline execution at regular time intervals, similar to a scheduled trigger.
    - However, unlike a schedule that runs at a specific point in time, a tumbling window trigger defines a window of time for which the pipeline is eligible to run.
- **Non-overlapping Windows:** Tumbling windows are fixed-sized, non-overlapping intervals. Once a window closes (the end time is reached), a new, independent window opens, and the pipeline might run again if the trigger conditions are still met.

**Configuration:**

- **Start and End Time:** You define the start and end time for the tumbling window.
    - The pipeline can potentially run any time within this window.
- **Recurrence:** You specify the recurrence pattern for the window, such as every hour, day, week, etc.
- **Offset (Optional):** An optional offset allows delaying the start of subsequent windows relative to the previous window's end time. This can be useful for ensuring some processing buffer between pipeline executions.

**Use Cases:**

- **Periodic Data Processing:** Tumbling window triggers are ideal for scenarios where you need to process data at regular intervals, such as:
    - Daily sales data processing.
    - Hourly website analytics refresh.
    - Batch data processing tasks running on a recurring schedule.
- **Backfill Processing:** Tumbling window triggers can handle backfill processing.
    - If the trigger start time is set in the past, ADF can initiate pipeline runs for windows that have already passed.
    - This is useful for catching up on missed executions or historical data processing.

**Things to Consider:**

- **Trigger Dependency (Optional):** You can configure tumbling window triggers to depend on the successful completion of another trigger before starting the pipeline. This can be useful for ensuring a specific order of execution within your data pipelines.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor your tumbling window trigger executions within the ADF monitoring interface to ensure they are firing as expected.

**Event-based Triggers:** There are two main subtypes:

- **Storage Event Trigger:** This trigger fires when a specific event occurs in an Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
    - Events can include creating, deleting, modifying, or renaming a file/folder.
- **Custom Event Trigger:** This trigger allows you to integrate with external event sources using Azure Event Grid or Web hooks.
    - These events can then trigger pipeline executions.

**Manual Trigger:** This trigger allows you to manually initiate a pipeline run through the ADF user interface or programmatically using the ADF REST API.
