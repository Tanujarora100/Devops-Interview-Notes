# AZURE DATA FLOWS
Azure Data Flows are a visual data transformation capability within Azure Data Factory (ADF). They allow you to build data transformation logic without writing code. Here's a deeper dive into what they are and how they work:

**What are Azure Data Flows?**

- **Visual Designer:** Data flows provide a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality. You can connect data sources, apply transformations, and define outputs using a visual canvas.
- **Code-free Transformations:** Data flows offer a wide range of built-in transformations that you can configure without writing any code. These transformations cover various data manipulation tasks, including filtering, aggregation, joining, pivoting, and more.
- **Integration with ADF Pipelines:** Data flows are designed to work seamlessly within ADF pipelines. You can integrate data flow activities into your pipelines to orchestrate the entire data movement and processing workflow.

**Benefits of using Azure Data Flows:**

- **Improved Developer Productivity:** The visual designer allows data engineers and analysts to build data transformations without coding expertise, accelerating development cycles.
- **Reduced Errors:** The visual interface minimizes the risk of errors from manual coding, leading to more reliable data pipelines.
- **Maintainability:** Data flows are easier to understand and maintain compared to complex code-based transformations.
- **Scalability:** Data flows leverage the underlying distributed processing power of Azure, ensuring they can handle large datasets efficiently.

**How Data Flows Work:**

1. **Data Source Selection:** You start by selecting the data source for your transformation. Data flows can access various data sources supported by ADF, including cloud storage, databases, and even other data flows.
2. **Transformation Application:** You visually drag and drop the desired transformations onto the data flow canvas. 
3. **Data Flow Execution:** Once the data flow is designed, you can integrate it into an ADF pipeline. When the pipeline is triggered, the data flow activity executes the defined transformations on the data.
4. **Output Definition:** You specify the output destination for the transformed data. It can be another data source, a data lake, or eve
