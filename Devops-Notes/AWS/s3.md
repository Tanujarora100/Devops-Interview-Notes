# S3
- maximum object size: 5TB
- maximum bucket size: not mentioned
- maximum number of buckets: 100

## Storage Classes

- **S3 Standards (default)**:
    - The objects are stored in at least 3 AZs
    - Should be used for data frequently accessed
    - No Retrieval Fee
    - No Minimum Duration Costing
- **S3 Standard-IA**:
    - more cost effective for storing data
    - Retrieval fee present 
    - smaller objects will be billed as being 128 KB
- **S3 One Zone-IA**:
    - cheaper than Standard IA and Standard
    - Retrieval fee present 
    - smaller objects charged also present

- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**:
    - It like S3 Standard-IA, but with cheaper
    - Recommended for data that is infrequently accessed (once per quarter)
    - Minimum Charge for 90 days for each object.
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**:
    - Storage cost is about 1/6 of S3 standard
    - Objects in Glacier class are just pointers to real objects and they can not be made public
    - Retrieval job types:
        - **Expedited**:  1-5 minutes
        - **Standard**: 3-5 hours
        - **Bulk**: 5-12 hours at lower cost
    - Glacier has a **40KB** minimum billable size
    - **90 days** minimum duration for storage

- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**:
    - Deep Archive represents data in a frozen state
    - Has a 40KB minimum billable data size 
    - 180 days minimum duration for data storage
    - Restore jobs are longer:
        - **Standard**: up to 12 hours
        - **Bulk**: up to 48 hours


- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**:
    - It is a storage class containing 5 different tiering a storage
    - We don't have to worry for moving objects over tier, this is done by the storage class automatically
    - Intelligent tier can be configured, archiving data is optional and can be enabled/disabled
    - There is no retrieval cost for moving data between frequent and infrequent tiers, we will be billed based on the automation cost per 1000 objects

## S3 Lifecycle Configuration

- A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules applied to a bucket or a group of objects in a bucket
- Rules consist of actions:
    - Transition actions: 
    - Expiration actions: 

- Considerations:
    - An object needs to remain for at **least 30 days in standard tier before being able to be moved to infrequent tiers** (objects can be uploaded manually in infrequent tiers)
    - A single rule can not move objects instantly from standard IA to infrequent tiers and then to Glacier tiers. 
    - Objects have to stay for at least 30 days in infrequent tiers before being able to be moved by one rule only. In order ot overcome this, we can define 2 different rules

## S3 Replication

- 2 types of replication are supported by S3:
    - Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    - Same-Region Replication (SRR)
- Both types of replication support same account replication and cross-account replication
- If we configure cross-account replication, we have to define a policy on the destination account to allow replication from the source account
- We can create replicate all objects from a bucket or we can create rules for a subset of objects. 
- We can filter objects to replicate
- Replication Time Control (RTC): if enabled ensures a 15 minutes replication of objects
- Replication consideration:
    - By default replication is not retroactive: only newer objects are replicated after the replication is enabled
    - Versioning needs to be enabled for both source and destination buckets
    - Batch replication can be used to replicate existing objects. It needs to be specifically configured. If it is not, replication wont be retroactive
    - Replication by default one-way only, source => destination. There is an option to use bi-directional replication, but this has to be configured
    - Replication is capable of handling objects encrypted with SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS (with extra configuration). SSE-C (customer managed keys) is also supported, historically it was incompatible
    - Replication requires for the owner of source bucket needs permissions on the objects which will be replicated
    - System events will not be replicated, only user events
    - Any objects in the Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive will not be replicated
    - By default, deletion are not replicated. We can enable replication for deletion events
- Replication use cases:
    - SRR:
        - Log aggregation
        - PROD and Test sync
        - Resilience with strict sovereignty
    - CRR
        - Global resilience improvements
        - Latency reduction

## S3 Encryption

- Buckets aren't encrypted, objects inside buckets are encrypted
- Encryption at rest types:
    - Client-Side encryption: data is encrypted before it leaves the client
    - Server-Side encryption: data is encrypted at the server side, it is sent on plain-text format from the client
- There are 3 types of server-side encryption supported:
    - **SSE-C**: server-side encryption with customer-provided keys
        - Customer is responsible for managing the keys, S3 managed encryption/decryption
        - When an object is put into S3, we need to provide the key utilized
        - The object will be encrypted by the key, a hash is generated and stored for the key
        - The key will be discarded after the encryption is done
        - In case of object retrieval, we need to provide the key again
    - **SSE-S3** (default): server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys
        - AWS handles both the encryption/decryption and the key management
        - When using this method, S3 creates a master key for the encryption process (handled entirely by S3)
        - When an object is uploaded an unique key is used for encryption. After the encryption, this unique key is encrypted as well with the master key and the unencrypted key is discarded. Both the key and the object are stored together
        - For most situations, this is the default type of encryption. It uses AES-256 algorithm, they key management is entirely handled bt S3
    - **SSE-KMS**: Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
        - Similar to SSE-S3, but for this method the KMS handles stored keys
        - When an object is uploaded for the first time, S3 will communicate with KMS and creates a customer master key (CMK). This is default master key used in the future
        - When new objects are uploaded AWS uses the CMK to generate individual keys for encryption (data encryption keys). The data encryption key will be stored along with the object in encrypted format
        - We don't have to use the default CMK provided by AWS, we can use our own CMK. We can control the permission on it and how it is regulated
        - SSE-KMS provides role separation:
            - We can specify who can access the CMK from KMS
            - Administrators can administers buckets but they may not have access to KMS keys
- Default Bucket Encryption:
    - When an object is uploaded, we can specify which server-side encryption to be used by adding a header to the request: `x-amz-server-side-encryption`
    - Values for the header:
        - To use SSE-S3: `AES256`
        - To use SSE-KMS: `aws:kms`
    - All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically encrypted at rest
    - Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the default encryption configuration for every bucket in Amazon S3, this can be overridden in a PUT request with `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header

## S3 Bucket Keys

- Each object in a bucket is using a uniq data-encryption key (DEK)
- AWS uses the bucket's KMS key to generate this data-encryption key
- Calls to KMS have a cost and levels where throttling occurs: 5500/10_000/50_000 PUT/sec depending on region
- Bucket keys:
    - A time limited bucket key is used to generate DEKs within S3
    - KMS generates a bucket key and gives it to S3 to use to generate DEKs for each upload, offloading the load from KMS to S3
    - Reduces the number of KMS API calls => reduces the costs/increases scalability
- Using bucket keys is not retroactive, it will only affect objects after bucket keys are enabled
- Thing to keep in mind after enabling bucket keys:
    - CloudTrail KMS event logs will show the bucket ARN instead of the object ARN
    - Fewer CloudTrail events of KMS will be in the logs (since work is offloaded to S3)
    - Bucket keys work with SRR and CRR; the object encryption settings are maintained
    - If we replicate plaintext to a bucket using bucket keys, the object is encrypted at the destination side; this can result in ETAG changes on the object

## S3 Presigned URLs

- Is a way to give other people access to our buckets using our credentials
- An IAM admin can generate a presigned URL for a specific object using his credentials. This URL will have an expiry date
- The presigned URL can be given to unauthenticated uses in order to access the object
- The user will interact with S3 using the presigned URL as if it was the person who generated the presigned URL
- Presigned URLs can be used for downloads and for uploads
- Presigned URLs can be used for giving direct access private files to an application user offloading load from the application. This approach will require a service account for the application which will generate the presigned URLs
- Presigned URL considerations:
    - We can create a presigned ULR for objects we don't have access to
    - When using the URL, the permissions match the identity which generated it. The permissions are evaluated at the moment of accessing the object (it might happen the the identity had its permissions revoked, meaning we wont have access to the object either)
    - We should not generate presigned URLs generated on temporary credentials (assuming an IAM role). When the temporary credentials are expired, the presigned URL will stop working as well. Recommended to use long-term identities such as an IAM user

## S3 Select and Glacier Select

- Are ways to retrieve parts of objects instead of entire objects
- S3 can store huge objects (up to 5 TB)
- Retrieving a huge objects will take time and consume transfer capacity
- S3/Glacier provides services to access partial objects using SQL-like statements to select parts of objects
- Both S3 Select and Glacier selects supports the following formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet, BZIP2 compression for CSV and JSON

## S3 Access Points

- Access Points simplify the process of managing access to S3 buckets/objects
- Rather than 1 bucket (1 bucket policy) access we can create many access points with different policies
- Each access point can be limited from where it can be accessed, and each can have different network access controls
- Each access point has its own endpoint address
- We can create access point using the console or the CLI using `aws s3control create-access-point --name < name > --account-id < account-id > --bucket < bucket-name >`
- Any permission defined on the access point needs to be defined on the bucket policy as well. 
- We can do delegation, by defining wide access permissions in the bucket policy and granular permissions on the access point policy

## S3 Block Public Access

- The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help manage public access to Amazon S3 resources
- The settings we can configure with the Block Public Access Feature are:
    - **IgnorePublicAcls**: this prevents any new ACLs to be created or existing ACLs being modified which enable public access to the object. With this alone existing ACLs will not be affected
    - **BlockPublicAcls**: Any ACLs actions that exist with public access will be ignored, this does not prevent them being created but prevents their effects
    - **BlockPublicPolicy**: This prevents a bucket policy containing public actions from being created or modified on an S3 bucket, the bucket itself will still allow the existing policy
    - **RestrictPublicBuckets**: this will prevent non AWS services or authorized users (such as an IAM user or role) from being able to publicly access objects in the bucket

## S3 Cost Saving Options

- S3 Lifecycle Rules
- Compress objects
- S3 Requester Pays:
    - With Requester Pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request
    - Requires a bucket policy

## S3 Object Lock

- Object Lock can be enabled on newly created S3 buckets. 
- For existing ones in order to enable Object Lock we have to contact AWS support
- Versioning will be also enabled when Object Lock is enabled
- Object Lock can not be disabled, versioning can not be suspended when Object Lock is active on the bucket
- Object Lock is a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) architecture: when an object is written, can not be modified. Individual versions of objects are locked
- There are 2 ways S3 managed object retention:
    - Retention Period
    - Legal Hold
- Object Lock retentions can be individually defined on object versions, a bucket can have default Object Lock settings


## **S3 Compliance Mode vs Governance Mode**

### **Compliance Mode**
- **Immutability**: Objects locked in compliance mode cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user of the AWS account.
- **Retention Period**: Once set, the retention period cannot be shortened or removed.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for environments with stringent regulatory or legal requirements where data must remain unchangeable and undeletable for a specified period.
- **Deletion**: The only way to delete an object under compliance mode before its retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.

### **Governance Mode**
- **Immutability**: Objects are protected against deletion and overwriting by most users. 
- However, users with specific permissions can alter the retention settings or delete the objects.
- **Retention Period**: The retention period can be modified or removed by users with the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature                | Compliance Mode                               | Governance Mode                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Immutability**       | Cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including root user | Protected against most users; privileged users can modify or delete |
| **Retention Period**   | Cannot be shortened or removed                | Can be modified or removed by privileged users |
| **Use Case**           | Regulatory and legal compliance               | Flexible data management and testing retention settings |
| **Deletion**           | Only by deleting the AWS account              | By privileged users with specific permissions |

### **Legal Hold**

- **Purpose**: A legal hold can be placed on an object version to prevent it from being deleted or modified, regardless of the retention period.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used to preserve data involved in legal or compliance matters until the hold is explicitly removed by users with special permissions.

### Legal Hold
- We don't set a retention period for this type of retention, Legal Hold can be on or off for specific versions of an object
- We can't delete or overwrite an object with Legal Hold
- An extra permission is required when we want to add or remove the Legal Hold on an object: `s3:PutObjectLegalHold`
- Legal Hold can be used for preventing accidental removals
