### VPC Peering in AWS

**VPC Peering** is a networking connection between two **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** that allows traffic to be routed `between them using private IP addresses`. The VPCs can be in the **same AWS account** or in **different AWS accounts** and even in **different regions**.



### **VPC Peering in the Same AWS Account**

#### Steps to Set Up VPC Peering in the Same Account:

1. **Create VPCs**:
   - Make sure both VPCs are in the same or different regions, as needed.
   - Ensure that the CIDR blocks of the VPCs **do not overlap**

2. **Request a VPC Peering Connection**:
   - Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select **Peering Connections** from the navigation panel.
   - Click on **Create Peering Connection**.
   - Choose the **Requester VPC** (the one initiating the request).
   - Select the **Peer VPC** from the same account.

3. **Accept the VPC Peering Request**:
   - After creating the request, go to **Peering Connections**, select the newly created connection, and click on **Actions** -> **Accept Request**.

4. **Update Route Tables**:
   - Go to the **Route Tables** of both VPCs.
   - Add routes for the peering connection:
     - In VPC A’s route table, add a route to VPC B’s CIDR block, pointing to the peering connection.
     - In VPC B’s route table, `add a route to VPC A’s CIDR block, pointing to the peering connection.`

5. **Update Security Groups**:
   - Modify the **security groups** in both VPCs to allow inbound/outbound traffic from the peer VPC’s CIDR block.

6. **DNS Resolution (Optional)**:
   - If you want DNS resolution between VPCs, enable **DNS resolution** by modifying the VPC settings.
   - Go to the VPC settings and set `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` to `true`.

#### Steps to Set Up VPC Peering Across Different Accounts:

1. **Create VPCs**:
   - Both VPCs must exist in different AWS accounts.
   - Ensure the **CIDR blocks do not overlap** between the two VPCs.

2. **Request a VPC Peering Connection**:
   - Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in Account A (requester).
   - Select **Peering Connections**, then **Create Peering Connection**.
   - In the **Peering Connection** form, select the **Requester VPC**.
   - Under **Peer VPC**, choose **Another Account**.
   - Enter the **AWS Account ID** for Account B and select the **VPC ID** for the peer VPC in Account B.

3. **Accept the VPC Peering Request in the Peer Account (Account B)**:
   - Log in to **Account B**.
   - Go to the **VPC Dashboard** and select **Peering Connections**.
   - You should see the pending peering request from Account A. Select the request and **Accept** it.

4. **Update Route Tables**:
   - Update the **route tables** in both VPCs (in both accounts) to allow traffic to flow between them.
     - In VPC A, add a route to VPC B’s CIDR block, pointing to the peering connection.
     - In VPC B, add a route to VPC A’s CIDR block, pointing to the peering connection.

5. **Update Security Groups**:
   - Modify the **security groups** in both VPCs to allow traffic from the peer VPC’s CIDR block. For example, in VPC A, allow inbound/outbound traffic from VPC B's CIDR block, and vice versa.

6. **DNS Resolution (Optional)**:
   - If you need DNS resolution between the VPCs, enable **DNS resolution** in both accounts by modifying the VPC settings (`enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` to `true`).
   - Enable **DNS resolution support for the VPC peering connection** by setting the correct options in the peering connection settings.

7. **Cross-Account IAM Permissions (Optional)**:
   - In some cases, you may need to configure **IAM policies** to allow cross-account actions, especially if using infrastructure as code or automated scripts.
   - For example, you can define a policy to allow VPC peering requests between specific VPCs and accounts.

### **Important Considerations for VPC Peering**

- **Overlapping CIDR Blocks**: .
- **Transit Peering is Not Allowed**: VPC Peering is non-transitive. This means if you have a VPC peered with two other VPCs, traffic cannot pass through a third VPC. For transitive connections, consider using **AWS Transit Gateway**.
- **Cost**: There is no charge for creating VPC peering connections. 
- However, **data transfer charges** do apply based on the data transferred between VPCs, especially across regions.
- **Security Group Rules**: Ensure that security groups are properly configured to allow traffic between the VPCs.

### **Differences Between Same Account and Cross-Account VPC Peering**
| Aspect                      | Same Account                               | Different Accounts                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Peering Setup**            | Simpler setup as both VPCs are in the same account. | Slightly more complex due to cross-account permission management. |
| **Permissions**              | No additional permissions required.        | Must know the peer account ID and may need cross-account permissions (IAM). |
| **Acceptance**               | Peering request can be accepted in the same account. | Requires logging into the other account to accept the peering request. |
| **DNS Settings**             | Can enable DNS resolution easily.          | DNS resolution must be enabled in both accounts, and cross-account settings must be verified. |
