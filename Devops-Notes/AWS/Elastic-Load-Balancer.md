## AWS Elastic Load Balancer and Elastic IP Overview

### **Elastic IP**

An Elastic IP is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing in AWS. It can be associated with any instance or network interface in your VPC.

- **Association**: An Elastic IP can only be associated with one instance or network interface at a time.
- **Limit**: By default, AWS allows up to 5 Elastic IPs per region per account[1][3].
- **Usage**: Elastic IPs are used to mask the failure of an instance by quickly remapping the address to another instance in your account[1][2].

### **Subnets**

- **Public Subnet**: Has a direct route to an internet gateway, allowing instances to communicate directly with the internet.
- **Private Subnet**: Does not have a direct route to the internet and typically uses a NAT gateway for internet access[4][5][6].

### **Kinds of Load Balancers**

AWS provides several types of load balancers to handle different types of traffic and use cases:

#### **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Components**:
  - **Listeners**: Check for connection requests based on configured protocol/port.
  - **Rules**: Define how to route traffic to target groups.
  - **Target Groups**: Groups of resources to which traffic is directed.
- **Features**:
  - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - Supports WebSockets and HTTP/2.
  - IPv6 support.
  - Path-based and host-based routing.
  - Integration with AWS WAF.
  - Sticky sessions (session affinity)[7][8][9].

#### **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- **Handles**: TCP and UDP traffic.
- **Features**:
  - High performance and low latency.
  - Operates at Layer 4.
  - Preserves the source IP address of the client.

#### **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
- **Purpose**: Integrates third-party virtual appliances like firewalls.
- **Features**:
  - Operates at Layer 3 (network layer).
  - Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081.
  - Acts as a single entry and exit point for network traffic[7][8][9].

#### **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**
- **Legacy**: An older type of load balancer that supports both Layer 4 and Layer 7 traffic.

### **Key Concepts and Features**

#### **Connection Draining**
- **Definition**: Allows existing connections to complete while preventing new connections to instances that are deregistering or unhealthy.

#### **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**
- **Definition**: Distributes traffic evenly across all registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones[9].

#### **Sticky Sessions**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a user's session is consistently routed to the same target using cookies to track sessions[9].

#### **Integration with Auto Scaling**
- **Definition**: Automatically adds or removes instances from the load balancer's target group as the Auto Scaling group scales in or out[9].

### **Security Measures**

- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Offloads the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption to the load balancer.
- **Integration with AWS WAF**: Protects web applications from common web exploits.
- **Security Groups and ACLs**: Control inbound and outbound traffic to the load balancer[9].

### **Challenges and Optimization Strategies**

#### **Challenges**
- Configuring health checks correctly.
- Managing security settings.
- Handling sudden traffic spikes.

#### **Optimization Strategies**
- Using the appropriate type of load balancer for your needs.
- Monitoring usage and scaling down when necessary.
- Considering Reserved Instances for cost savings.

### **Setting Up a Highly Available Architecture Using ELB**

1. **Deploy Application Across Multiple Availability Zones**: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
2. **Create an ELB**: Choose the appropriate type of load balancer.
3. **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly across all targets.
4. **Set Up Health Checks**: Regularly checks the health of targets.
5. **Integrate with Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.

### **Algorithms for Load Balancers**

| Algorithm          | How It Works                                    | Benefits                                  | Drawbacks                              | Use Cases                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Round Robin**    | Cyclically distributes requests to servers      | Simple, even distribution if servers are similar | Assumes identical server capacity      | Environments with similar server performance|
| **Least Connections** | Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections | Prevents server overload, dynamic adaptation | Ignores server capacity, more complex | Varying server loads and capacities         |
| **IP Hash**        | Uses client's IP address to determine server assignment | Provides session persistence              | Can lead to uneven load distribution   | Applications requiring consistent server assignment |

### **Path-Based and Host-Based Routing**

- **Path-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on the URL path.
  - **Listener Rules**: Define path patterns to match.
  - **Target Groups**: Each path pattern is associated with a specific target group.
  - **Use Case**: Hosting multiple microservices behind a single ALB.

- **Host-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on the host header in the HTTP request.
  - **Listener Rules**: Define host conditions.
  - **Target Groups**: Each host condition is associated with a specific target group.
  - **Use Case**: Hosting multiple applications or services on different subdomains.

### **Availability Zones**

- **Definition**: Distinct locations within an AWS region engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.
- **Typical Count**: 3 to 6 AZs per region.
## **Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs. Network Load Balancer (NLB) Security Comparison**

### **Security Features**

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Layer**: Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
- **Protocols**: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC protocols.
- **Security Features**:
  - **SSL Termination**: ALB can terminate SSL/TLS connections, which allows for offloading the SSL decryption process from backend servers. This can simplify certificate management and reduce the computational load on backend instances.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature                     | ALB (Application Load Balancer) | NLB (Network Load Balancer) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **OSI Layer**               | Layer 7 (Application)            | Layer 4 (Transport)         |
| **Protocols Supported**     | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC                | TCP, UDP, TLS               |
| **SSL/TLS Termination**     | Yes                              | Yes                         |
| **Web Application Firewall**| Yes (AWS WAF integration)        | No                          |
| **User Authentication**     | Yes (Amazon Cognito, OIDC)       | No                          |
| **Static IP**               | No                               | Yes                         |

| **Routing**                 | Content-based routing            | Flow hash algorithm         |

## **ALB Health Check Paths**

Application Load Balancers (ALBs) use health checks to monitor the status of their registered targets. These health checks ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances, improving the reliability and availability of your application.

### **Health Check Configuration**

- **Health Check Path**: The URL path that the ALB uses to perform health checks on the targets. For example, `/health` or `/status`.
- **Health Check Interval**: The time interval between health checks.
- **Timeout**: The amount of time to wait for a response before marking the health check as failed.
- **Healthy Threshold**: The number of consecutive successful health checks required before considering a target healthy.
- **Unhealthy Threshold**: The number of consecutive failed health checks required before considering a target unhealthy.

### **Example Configuration**

```hcl
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-tg"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id

  health_check {
    path                = "/health"
    interval            = 30
    timeout             = 5
    healthy_threshold   = 3
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
  }
}
```

In this example, the health check is configured to check the `/health` path every 30 seconds, with a timeout of 5 seconds. A target is considered healthy after 3 consecutive successful checks and unhealthy after 2 consecutive failed checks.

### **Checking Health Status**

You can check the health status of your targets using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. For example, using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <target-group-arn>
```
## **SSL Termination: Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

### **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

**SSL Termination Process**:
- **Layer**: ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: ALB can terminate SSL/TLS connections. This means that it decrypts incoming encrypted traffic before forwarding it to the backend instances. The process involves:
  - **Certificate Management**: You can upload SSL certificates to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM and associate them with the ALB. The ALB uses these certificates to decrypt incoming traffic[1][3][9].
  - **X-Forwarded-Proto Header**: ALB can add the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to requests, indicating whether the original request was HTTP or HTTPS. This is useful for applications that need to know the original protocol[1].
  - **SSL Offloading**: By offloading the SSL termination to the ALB, backend instances are relieved from the computational overhead of decrypting traffic, allowing them to focus on serving content[3].

**Security Features**:
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: ALB integrates with AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user authentication using Amazon Cognito or OIDC-compliant identity providers.
- **Advanced Routing**: Can inspect and route traffic based on content, which can be used to enforce security policies at the application level.

### **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

**SSL Termination Process**:
- **Layer**: NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
- **TLS Termination**: NLB can terminate TLS connections. This involves:
  - **Certificate Management**: Similar to ALB, you can use ACM or IAM to manage certificates. NLB uses these certificates to decrypt incoming TLS traffic[6][8][10].
  - **Source IP Preservation**: Unlike ALB, NLB preserves the source IP address of the client, which is forwarded to the backend instances even after TLS termination. This is beneficial for logging and security purposes[6][8].
  - **Simplified Management**: Centralized certificate management reduces the complexity of distributing certificates across multiple backend servers. Certificates are securely stored, rotated, and updated automatically by AWS[6][8].

**Security Features**:
- **DDoS Protection**: Integrated with AWS Shield for protection against DDoS attacks.
- **Static IP**: Provides a static IP address, simplifying firewall configurations.
- **Zero-day Patching**: AWS updates the NLB to respond to emerging threats, ensuring backend servers are protected[6][8].
- **Access Logs**: Detailed access logs can be enabled, providing information about TLS protocol versions, cipher suites, connection times, and more[6][8].

### **Conclusion**

Both ALB and NLB offer SSL/TLS termination, but they handle it differently due to their positions in the OSI model and their intended use cases:

- **ALB** is ideal for web applications that require advanced routing, user authentication, and integration with AWS WAF. It terminates SSL/TLS at the application layer, providing features like content-based routing and the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.
- **NLB** is suitable for applications that need high performance, low latency, and preservation of the client's source IP. It terminates TLS at the transport layer, offering simplified certificate management, zero-day patching, and detailed access logs.
