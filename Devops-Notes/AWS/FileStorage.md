Here is a comparison of object storage and file storage in a tabular format:

| Feature | Object Storage | File Storage |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Data Structure | Flat, no hierarchy | Hierarchical with directories and files |
| Metadata | Extensive, customizable metadata per object | Limited metadata per file |
| Scalability | Highly scalable, can store petabytes of data | Limited scalability, performance degrades with large amounts of data |
| Retrieval | Uses unique object identifiers, not file paths | Requires specifying the full file path to retrieve data |
| Access | Accessed via API calls, often RESTful | Accessed via file protocols like NFS or SMB |
| Use Cases | Unstructured data, big data analytics, content storage | Structured data, home directories, application data |
| Examples | Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Google Cloud Storage | Network Attached Storage (NAS), Windows file shares, NFS servers |


| Feature       | Object Storage                                     | File Storage                                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency**   | Higher Latency due to flat structure. | Lower latency, as data retrieval is typically faster due to the hierarchical structure
| **Performance** | Performance can vary widely based on the architecture and configuration. Object storage excels in handling large datasets and high throughput but may struggle with latency in certain applications, such as AI, where quick response times are critical[2][4]. | Generally offers better performance for traditional workloads, especially when accessing a smaller number of files. Throughput can decrease as the number of directories and files increases, but it remains efficient for structured data access[5]. |
