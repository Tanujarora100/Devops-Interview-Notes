- `/proc` is a virtual file system.
- Proc files are created by the kernel itself.

## Structure and Purpose of `/proc`

The `/proc` directory contains a hierarchy of special files that provide detailed information about system processes, hardware, and kernel parameters. Each running process has a dedicated directory named after its process ID (PID), which contains files that provide insights into the process's status, memory usage, and more. For example, the directory `/proc/1234` (where `1234` is a PID) includes files such as:

- `/proc/PID/cmdline`: Command line arguments used to start the process.
- `/proc/PID/status`: Human-readable status of the process.
- `/proc/PID/stat`: Detailed statistics about the process.
- `/proc/cpuinfo`: Information about the CPU(s).
- `/proc/meminfo`: Memory usage statistics.
- `/proc/filesystems`: A list of file systems supported by the kernel.

## Virtual Files and Their Characteristics

Files within `/proc` are often referred to as virtual files because they are not stored on disk but are generated by the kernel in real-time. Most of these files appear to have a size of zero bytes, but when accessed, they return significant amounts of information. For example, using the command `cat /proc/cpuinfo` displays detailed CPU information, while `cat /proc/meminfo` provides memory statistics[

The `/proc` file system also allows users to interact with kernel parameters. Some files within `/proc/sys` can be modified to change kernel settings on-the-fly, providing a means for real-time configuration adjustments

## Key Files and Directories

Here are some notable files and directories within `/proc`:

- **`/proc/filesystems`**: Lists all file systems supported by the kernel.
- **`/proc/loadavg`**: Shows the system load average over different intervals.
- **`/proc/uptime`**: Displays the total time the system has been running.
- **`/proc/stat`**: Contains various statistics about system performance, including CPU usage and process counts.
