## What is Nohup?
- **Nohup** stands for "no hang up." 
- It prevents the processes from receiving the SIGHUP (Signal Hang Up) signal.
- Whenever you stop the terminal the SIGHUP signal is sent but in no hup mode it will not be sent to the no hup process.

```bash
nohup command [arguments] &
```
## Advantages of Using Nohup

1. **Persistence**: Keeps processes running even after the user logs out.
2. **Output Management**: Allows for easy redirection of output.
3. **Background Execution**: Enables running long tasks without occupying the terminal.

Daemonizing a process in Linux involves running a process in the background, detached from any terminal, with its own session, and typically configured to start automatically on system boot. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to daemonize a process:

### Method 1: Using `systemd` (Preferred Method on Modern Systems)

`systemd` is the init system used by most modern Linux distributions. It provides a standardized way to manage services and daemons.

1. **Create a Systemd Service File:**
   
   Create a service file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example, to daemonize a script called `myapp.sh`, create a file called `myapp.service`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
   ```

2. **Define the Service:**

   Add the following content to the service file:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=MyApp Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/path/to/myapp.sh
   Restart=always
   User=nobody
   Group=nogroup

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   - **ExecStart:** The command to start your process.
   - **Restart:** Configures the service to restart automatically if it fails.
   - **User/Group:** Specifies the user and group under which the service should run (adjust as needed).
   - **WantedBy:** Determines the target to which this service should be attached.

3. **Reload Systemd Daemon:**

   Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. **Start and Enable the Service:**

   Start the service and enable it to run on boot.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start myapp.service
   sudo systemctl enable myapp.service
   ```

5. **Check the Status:**

   Verify that the service is running.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status myapp.service
   ```

### Method 2: Daemonizing Manually in a Script

For systems not using `systemd` or for custom scripts, you can manually daemonize a process using the following approach:

1. **Fork the Process:**

   The process forks itself using `fork()` to create a child process. The parent process exits, leaving the child running.

2. **Disassociate from Terminal (Session and Process Group):**

   The child process calls `setsid()` to start a new session and process group, becoming the leader of that session and group.

3. **Change Working Directory:**

   Change the working directory to a safe location (usually `/`).

4. **Redirect Standard File Descriptors:**

   Redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to `/dev/null`, or to log files if you want to capture output.

5. **Example Script to Daemonize a Process:**

   Here’s a basic example in C:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <sys/types.h>
   #include <sys/stat.h>
   #include <fcntl.h>

   void daemonize()
   {
       pid_t pid;

       // Fork the process
       pid = fork();

       if (pid < 0)
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

       // Exit the parent process
       if (pid > 0)
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

       // Create a new session
       if (setsid() < 0)
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

       // Ignore signal sent from child to parent process
       signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);

       // Fork again to ensure the process cannot acquire a terminal again
       pid = fork();

       if (pid < 0)
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

       if (pid > 0)
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

       // Change the working directory to the root directory
       chdir("/");

       // Close standard file descriptors
       close(STDIN_FILENO);
       close(STDOUT_FILENO);
       close(STDERR_FILENO);

       // Redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null
       open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY); // stdin
       open("/dev/null", O_WRONLY); // stdout
       open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);   // stderr
   }

   int main()
   {
       // Daemonize the process
       daemonize();

       // Your code here (e.g., a loop to keep the daemon running)
       while (1) {
           // Do some work here
           sleep(30); // Example sleep
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

6. **Compile and Run:**

   Compile the C program:

   ```bash
   gcc -o mydaemon mydaemon.c
   ```

   Run the compiled daemon:

   ```bash
   ./mydaemon &
   ```

   This will run `mydaemon` in the background as a daemon.

### Method 3: Using `nohup` and `&` (Basic Daemonization)

For simple cases, you can use `nohup` to daemonize a command. This method is not as robust as using `systemd` or writing a custom daemon, but it’s quick and easy.

```bash
nohup /path/to/your_command > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

- **nohup:** Ensures the command keeps running even after you log out.
- **&:** Runs the command in the background.
- **> /dev/null 2>&1:** Redirects stdout and stderr to `/dev/null` (discard).

### Summary

- **Use `systemd`** if you are on a modern Linux system; it provides robust management for daemons.
- **Manually daemonize** processes using a script when you need more control over the process or on systems without `systemd`.
- **Use `nohup`** for quick, simple daemonization without full service management.
