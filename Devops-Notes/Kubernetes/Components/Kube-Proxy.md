Kube-proxy is a critical component in Kubernetes that runs on each node within a cluster. Its primary role is to manage network rules that facilitate communication between services and pods. 

## **Functionality of Kube-proxy**

### **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**
Kube-proxy monitors the Kubernetes API for changes to Service and Endpoint objects.
- When a new service is created or an existing one is updated, **kube-proxy updates the network rules on each node to reflect these changes**.

### **Network Rule Management**
Kube-proxy can operate in several modes to manage network rules:
- **iptables Mode**: Uses the iptables tool to set up rules that capture and redirect traffic to the appropriate backend pods. 
- This mode is available only on Linux nodes.
- **IPVS Mode**: Uses IP Virtual Server (IPVS) for more efficient load balancing and scalability compared to iptables.
- **nftables Mode**: Uses nftables for packet filtering and classification, available on Linux nodes.
- **Kernelspace Mode**: Available on Windows nodes, this mode configures packet forwarding rules directly in the Windows kernel.

### **Traffic Forwarding**
Kube-proxy handles traffic forwarding for TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols. 
- It **does not understand HTTP but can forward HTTP traffic as TCP streams**. 
- It ensures that packets are directed to the correct pod, maintaining session affinity if required.


### **DaemonSet Deployment**
In most Kubernetes clusters, kube-proxy is deployed as a DaemonSet, ensuring that it runs on every node.

## **Benefits of Kube-proxy**
- **Service-to-Pod Mapping**: Maintains a network routing table that maps service IP addresses to the IP addresses of the pods.
- **Continuous Re-Mapping**: Continuously updates the routing table to reflect changes in the cluster
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple pods
- **Stable Communication**: Provides a stable IP address and DNS name for services.
