## Basic Components

### Control Plane
The control plane is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster. It consists of several key components:

- **Kubernetes API Server**: The API server is the entry point for all REST commands used to control the cluster. 
    - It processes API requests and updates the cluster state in etcd.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data
    - including configuration and state.
- **Kube-Scheduler**: Responsible for scheduling pods on nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
- **Kube-Controller-Manager**: Runs various controllers that handle routine tasks such as node management, replication, and endpoint management.
- **Cloud-Controller-Manager**: Manages cloud-specific control logic, allowing Kubernetes to interact with cloud provider APIs.

### Nodes


- **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node and **ensures containers are running in a pod**. It communicates with the control plane.
- **Kube-Proxy**: Maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to pods from inside or outside the cluster.
- **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers. 
    - Docker is a common runtime, but Kubernetes supports any runtime that adheres to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).


## Security
Kubernetes incorporates several security features:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages permissions within the cluster.
- **TLS Encryption**: Secures communication between components.
- **Image Scanning**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to scan container images for vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices
- **Update Regularly**: Ensure the cluster is running the latest Kubernetes version.
- **Training**: Invest in training for developers and operations teams.
- **Governance**: Establish enterprise-wide governance and align tools and vendors with Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Security**: Enhance security with image scanning, RBAC, and TLS encryption.
