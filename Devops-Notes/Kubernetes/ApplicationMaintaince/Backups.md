The following can be backed up:

- Resource Configurations
    - Good practice to keep this on SCM.
    - Declarative approach is the better approach.
- ETCD Cluster
- Persistent Volumes

### Backing up Resource Configuration

- use git to backup the configuration. 

If all the resources are not created this way, we can generate resource configuration by running `kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > all.yaml`. 

Recommended to use **Velero,** a managed tool for backups.

### Backing up ETCD Cluster

ETCD cluster can be backed up instead of generating the resource configuration for the cluster. **For this, backup the data directory of the ETCD cluster.** 

In managed k8s engine, ETCD data directory is not accessible. 
**In such cases, backup the resource configuration.**

`etcdctl` is a command line client for [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd).

- etcdctl snapshot save -h and keep a note of the mandatory global options.
- Since our ETCD database is TLS-Enabled, the following options are mandatory:
- –cacert                verify certificates of TLS-enabled secure servers using this CA bundle
- –cert                    identify secure client using this TLS certificate file
- –endpoints=[127.0.0.1:2379] This is the default as ETCD is running on master node and exposed on localhost **2379.**
- –key                  identify secure client using this TLS key file

etcd certificates are **used for encrypted communication between etcd member peers, as well as encrypted client traffic**. 
- The following certificates are generated and used by etcd and other processes that communicate with etcd: Peer certificates: Used for communication between etcd members.

## Velero

- Open-source
- Supports various plugins to backup the cluster to different storage locations like S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.
- Download the binary and run the `velero install` command along with the storage plugin and credentials to create the Velero pod looking for backups in the storage destination.
- **Works in CLI only**
- **Runs a velero container in the cluster**
- We can define a TTL for the backups stored in the storage location.
