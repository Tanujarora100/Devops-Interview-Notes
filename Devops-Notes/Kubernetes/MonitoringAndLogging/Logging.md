- Kubernetes does not come with logging mechanisms, we have different solutions like Dynatrace and data dog.
- Heapster is deprecated now

![alt text](image.png)
- We have a METRIC SERVER which retrieves the logs from the node and it is in memory solution.
- It does not store the logs on the disk so we need to go for the open source ones.
- **Kubernetes runs Kubelet on each node, kubelet contains sub component called as `C ADVISOR and then fetches the metrics` and exposes the data to the KUBE API SERVER.**
```bash
k top pod
# To show the information of the node
k top node

```
