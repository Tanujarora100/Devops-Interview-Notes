## **Termination Process Steps**

1. **Initiation of Termination**:
   - When a Pod termination is requested (e.g., via `kubectl delete pod`), Kubernetes updates the Pod status to reflect the time after which the Pod is considered "dead" (current time plus the grace period).
   - The Pod status is set to `Terminating`, and it is removed from the endpoints list of any associated Services to stop receiving new traffic.

2. **PreStop Hook Execution**:
   - If the Pod has a `preStop` hook defined, Kubernetes executes this hook before sending the termination signal. 
   - Graceful termination time starts and then the preStop Hook execution is done.
   - The grace period countdown begins before the `preStop` hook execution, so the hook must complete within the specified grace period.

3. **Sending SIGTERM Signal**:
   - Kubernetes sends a SIGTERM signal to the main process (PID 1) in each container of the Pod.
   - The application should handle the SIGTERM signal by stopping to accept new requests and completing any ongoing tasks.

4. **Grace Period**:
   - The default grace period is 30 seconds, but it can be configured using the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.
   - During this period, the application has time to shut down gracefully.

5. **Sending SIGKILL Signal**:
   - If the application does not terminate within the grace period, Kubernetes sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate any remaining processes[1][5][8].
   - This ensures that the Pod does not remain in a `Terminating` state indefinitely.

6. **Pod Deletion from API Server**:
   - Once all processes in the Pod are terminated, Kubernetes removes the Pod from the API server, completing the termination process[1][3][5].

## **Handling Special Cases**

- **Sidecar Containers**: If the Pod includes sidecar containers, Kubernetes will delay sending the TERM signal to these containers until the main containers have fully terminated. 
   - Sidecar containers are terminated in the reverse order of their definition.
- **Static Pods and Finalizers**: Static Pods and Pods with finalizers may have different termination behaviors. 
- For example, static Pods are not managed by the API server, and finalizers can delay the deletion until specific cleanup tasks are completed.

## **Example Configuration**

Hereâ€™s an example of a Pod specification with a `preStop` hook and a custom grace period:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
    lifecycle:
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 20"]
```

In this example, the `preStop` hook ensures that the container sleeps for 20 seconds before the SIGTERM signal is sent, and the total grace period is set to 60 seconds.
