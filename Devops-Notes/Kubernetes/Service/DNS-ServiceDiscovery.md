# DNS Resolution

### CoreDNS and Kubernetes API

CoreDNS is the DNS server used in most Kubernetes clusters. 
- It interacts with the Kubernetes API to keep track of the current state of all Services and Pods in the cluster.

1. **Pod Creation and Registration**:
   - When a Pod is created, it is assigned an IP address by the Kubernetes network plugin.
   - The Kubernetes API server registers this Pod and its IP address in the kube proxy.

2. **DNS Record Creation**:
   - CoreDNS watches the Kubernetes API for changes in the state of Pods and Services.
   - When a new Pod is created, CoreDNS creates a DNS A record for the Pod using its IP address and the naming convention `pod-ip-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example`.
   - For example, a Pod with IP `10.44.0.7` in the `default` namespace would have a DNS record `10-44-0-7.default.pod.cluster.local`.

3. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - If a Pod is deleted or its IP address changes, the Kubernetes API server updates its state.
   - CoreDNS receives these updates and dynamically adjusts the DNS records to reflect the current state.
   - This ensures that DNS queries always return the current IP addresses of the active Pods.
   - Watch Mechanism: The API server uses a watch mechanism to keep track of changes in etcd. Components like kubelet and CoreDNS subscribe to these updates.
CoreDNS Updates: When there is a change in the state of a Pod (e.g., creation, deletion, IP change), CoreDNS receives these updates via the API server. 
   - CoreDNS dynamically adjusts the DNS records to reflect the current state, ensuring that DNS queries return the current IP addresses of active Pods.

#### Interaction Flow
- Client Request: A client (e.g., kubectl) sends a request to create, modify, or delete a Pod.
- API Server Processing:
    - Authorize
    - Validate
    - Persist in etd
- Watch Notification: kubelet and CoreDNS, which watch for changes, are notified of the update.
- CoreDNS Adjustment: CoreDNS adjusts its DNS records
