**Kyverno** is a Kubernetes-native policy engine designed to manage, enforce, and validate configurations in Kubernetes clusters. 
- It allows administrators to define security, compliance, and operational policies as Kubernetes resources, making it easier to manage and audit these policies within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### How Kyverno Works:

1. **Policy Definition**: Kyverno policies are written in YAML format and define what actions should be taken on Kubernetes resources, such as validation, mutation, or generation of resource configurations.

2. **Admission Controller**: Kyverno runs as an admission controller within the Kubernetes API server. When a request is made to create, update, or delete a Kubernetes resource, Kyverno intercepts it.

3. **Policy Enforcement**: Kyverno evaluates the request against the defined policies. Based on the policy rules, it can:
   - **Validate**: Check if the resource configuration meets certain criteria.
   - **Mutate**: Automatically modify the resource configuration to adhere to best practices or organizational policies.
   - **Generate**: Create additional resources or configurations based on existing ones.

4. **Audit and Reports**: Kyverno can also audit existing resources to check compliance with policies and generate reports.
