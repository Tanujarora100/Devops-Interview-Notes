In Kubernetes, a **StorageClass** provides a way for administrators to define different classes of storage, each with its own parameters and characteristics.

### Key Concepts of Storage Classes

1. **Provisioner**:  
   - Each StorageClass has a provisioner that determines how PersistentVolume (PV) objects are created. 
   - The provisioner is specific to the storage backend, such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, or a network file system.

2. **Parameters**:  
   - The parameters section allows customization of storage. 
   - For example, in a StorageClass for AWS EBS, you can specify the type of volume (`gp2`, `io1`, etc.), the IOPS, or the file system type.

3. **Reclaim Policy**:  
   - This defines what happens to the storage when the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) using the StorageClass is deleted. 
   - Common options are `Retain`, `Recycle`, or `Delete`.

4. **Volume Binding Mode**:  
   The volume binding mode controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning occur. There are two modes:
   - `Immediate`: The default mode where the volume is bound as soon as a PVC is created.
   - `WaitForFirstConsumer`: The volume binding and provisioning are delayed until a Pod using the PVC is created. This is useful in multi-zone clusters to ensure that the PV is created in the same zone as the Pod.

5. **AllowVolumeExpansion**:  
   This field allows for the resizing of PersistentVolumes that were created using this StorageClass.

### Example of a StorageClass YAML

Here is an example of a simple StorageClass definition for an AWS EBS volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

### Usage in PersistentVolumeClaim

Once a StorageClass is defined, it can be referenced in a PersistentVolumeClaim like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mypvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: standard
```

In this example, the `mypvc` will request a 10Gi volume using the `standard` StorageClass, which is backed by an AWS EBS gp2 volume.

### Built-in and Default Storage Classes

- **Built-in Provisioners**: Some common provisioners include `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`, `kubernetes.io/gce-pd`, `kubernetes.io/azure-disk`, etc.
- **Default StorageClass**: If a cluster has a default StorageClass, it will be used if no `storageClassName` is specified in a PVC.
