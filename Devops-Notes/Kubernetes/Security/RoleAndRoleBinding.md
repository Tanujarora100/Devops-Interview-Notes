The main difference between a Role and a RoleBinding in Kubernetes RBAC is:

## Role

- Defines a set of permissions that can be granted to resources (users, groups, service accounts) within a namespace
- Specifies the allowed verbs (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete) on API groups and resources
- Scoped to a specific namespace

## RoleBinding

- Binds a Role to one or more subjects (users, groups, service accounts)
- Grants the permissions defined in the bound Role to the specified subjects
- Also scoped to a specific namespace

In summary:

- **Role** defines permissions
- **RoleBinding** associates those permissions with subjects

Some key points:

- **Roles** are namespace-scoped, while **ClusterRoles** are cluster-scoped and can be used to grant access across all namespaces
- **RoleBindings** can reference either a Role or a ClusterRole, but the permissions are still limited to the RoleBinding's namespace
- **ClusterRoleBindings** can be used to bind a ClusterRole to subjects across all namespaces

So in practice, you would:

1. **Define Roles** with the required permissions
2. **Create RoleBindings** to bind those Roles to the appropriate users, groups or service accounts
3. **Subjects** can be users, groups, or service accounts

This allows you to grant fine-grained access control to Kubernetes resources based on the principle of least privilege.
