## Before You Begin
1. **Read Release Notes**: Carefully read the release notes for the new Kubernetes version.
2. **Backup Important Components**: Ensure you back up critical components such as etcd.
3. **Disable Swap**: Swap must be disabled on all nodes.
4. **Check Cluster Health**: 

## Upgrade Control Plane

### Step 1: Upgrade `kubeadm` on Control Plane Nodes

1. **Upgrade `kubeadm`**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.x-00 && \
    sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
    ```
    Replace `1.30.x-00` with the latest patch version.

2. **Verify `kubeadm` Version**:
    ```bash
    kubeadm version
    ```

### Step 2: Plan the Upgrade

1. **Check Upgrade Plan**:
    ```bash
    sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
    ```

### Step 3: Apply the Upgrade

1. **Apply the Upgrade**:
    ```bash
    sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.30.x
    ```
    Replace `v1.30.x` with the desired version.

### Step 4: Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`

1. **Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.x-00 kubectl=1.30.x-00 && \
    sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
    ```

2. **Restart `kubelet`**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

### Step 5: Repeat for Additional Control Plane Nodes

Repeat steps 1-4 for each additional control plane node.

## Upgrade Worker Nodes

### Step 1: Drain the Node

1. **Drain the Node**:
    ```bash
    kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
    ```

### Step 2: Upgrade `kubeadm` on Worker Nodes

1. **Upgrade `kubeadm`**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.x-00 && \
    sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
    ```

### Step 3: Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`

1. **Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.x-00 kubectl=1.30.x-00 && \
    sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
    ```

2. **Restart `kubelet`**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

### Step 4: Uncordon the Node

1. **Uncordon the Node**:
    ```bash
    kubectl uncordon <node-name>
    ```

### Step 5: Repeat for Each Worker Node

Repeat steps 1-4 for each worker node.

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

1. **Verify Cluster Status**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

2. **Update Manifests**: Use **`kubectl convert`** to update resource manifests to the new API version if necessary.

3. **Check Add-ons**: Ensure all add-ons are compatible with the new Kubernetes version and update them if needed.
Handling third-party extensions during a Kubernetes upgrade involves several key steps to ensure compatibility and functionality throughout the process. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide:

## Steps to Handle Third-Party Extensions During a Kubernetes Upgrade

### 1. **Identify Third-Party Extensions**

- **List All Extensions**: Document all third-party extensions, add-ons, and integrations currently in use. This includes tools like Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, Istio, and others[5].

### 2. **Check Compatibility**

- **Review Documentation**: Consult the documentation for each third-party extension to check compatibility with the new Kubernetes version. This information is often found in the release notes or compatibility matrices provided by the extension developers.

### 3. **Backup Configurations**

- **Backup Configurations**: Ensure that all configuration files for third-party extensions are backed up. This prevents loss of custom settings during the upgrade process[2].

### 4. **Upgrade Extensions**

- **Sequential Upgrades**: Upgrade third-party extensions sequentially to avoid conflicts. Follow the specific upgrade instructions provided by the extension developers.
- **Use Helm**: If using Helm, update the Helm charts for each extension to the versions compatible with the new Kubernetes version.

### 5. **Test Upgrades in a Staging Environment**

- **Staging Environment**: Perform the upgrade in a staging environment first. This helps identify potential issues without affecting the production environment.
- **Run Tests**: Execute integration and functionality tests to ensure that the extensions work as expected after the upgrade.

### 6. **Monitor and Validate**

- **Monitor Logs**: After upgrading, monitor the logs of the third-party extensions for any errors or warnings.
- **Validate Functionality**: Validate that all functionalities provided by the third-party extensions are working correctly.

### 7. **Update Documentation**

- **Update Internal Docs**: Update your internal documentation to reflect any changes made during the upgrade process, including new configurations or known issues.

### 8. **Plan for Rollback**

- **Rollback Plan**: Have a rollback plan in place in case the upgrade causes unexpected issues. This plan should include steps to revert to the previous Kubernetes version and restore the backed-up configurations.

### Example: Upgrading Prometheus and Grafana

1. **Backup Configurations**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get configmap -n monitoring prometheus-config -o yaml > prometheus-config-backup.yaml
    kubectl get configmap -n monitoring grafana-config -o yaml > grafana-config-backup.yaml
    ```

2. **Upgrade Helm Charts**:
    ```bash
    helm repo update
    helm upgrade prometheus stable/prometheus --version <compatible-version>
    helm upgrade grafana stable/grafana --version <compatible-version>
    ```

3. **Monitor and Validate**:
    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n monitoring -l app=prometheus
    kubectl logs -n monitoring -l app=grafana
    ```
