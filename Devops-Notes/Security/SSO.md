## **How Single Sign-On (SSO) Works**
 

### **Key Components**

1. **Identity Provider (IdP):** The entity that authenticates the user and provides identity information to the service providers.Eg: AWS Cognito
2. **Service Provider (SP):** The entity that offers the service or application the user wants to access.
3. **Authentication Token:** A digital piece of information that verifies the userâ€™s identity and is passed between the IdP and SP.

### **SSO Workflow**

1. **User Request:** User Request the service provider
2. **Redirection to IdP:** Service Provider sends this request to IDP.
3. **User Authentication:** The IdP authenticates the user using their credentials.
4. **Token Issuance:** IDP Generates a token and then gives it to the service provider.
5. **Token Verification:** The SP receives the token and verifies its validity.
6. **Access Granted:** Once verified, the SP grants the user access to the requested service.

### **Detailed Steps**

1. **Initial Access Attempt:**
   - The user tries to access an application (SP).
   - The application detects that the user is not authenticated and redirects them to the IdP.

2. **Authentication at IdP:**
   - The user is presented with a login page by the IdP.
   - The user enters their credentials, which the IdP verifies against its database.
   - If the credentials are valid, the IdP creates an authentication token.

3. **Token Generation and Redirection:**
   - The authentication token contains user identity information and is signed by the IdP.

4. **Token Verification at SP:**
   - The SP receives the token and verifies its signature to ensure it was issued by a trusted IdP.
   - The SP extracts the user identity information from the token.

5. **Access Provision:**
   - The user can now access the application without needing to log in again.

6. **Subsequent Access to Other Applications:**
   - The second application redirects the user to the IdP.
   - Since the user is already authenticated, the IdP issues a new token without requiring the user to log in again.

### **SSO Protocols**

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):** An XML-based protocol.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to convey identity information.


### **Security Considerations**

- **Single Point of Failure:** If the IdP is compromised, all connected services are at risk. 
- **Token Security:** Tokens must be securely transmitted.

## **Role of SAML in Single Sign-On (SSO)**
### **What is SAML?**

SAML is an XML-based open standard used for exchanging authentication and authorization information between parties, specifically between an IdP and an SP.
