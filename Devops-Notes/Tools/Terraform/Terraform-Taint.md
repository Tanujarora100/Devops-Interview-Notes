## **Terraform Taint**

### **Purpose**
The `terraform taint` command is used to manually mark a resource as tainted, indicating that it needs to be destroyed and recreated during the next `terraform apply` operation. 

### **Usage**
- **Command**: `terraform taint [options] <address>`
- **Example**: `terraform taint aws_instance.example`

- **Deprecation**: 
- The recommended approach is to use the `-replace` option with `terraform apply` (e.g., `terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example"`).

### **Use Cases**
- **Failed Provisioning**: When a resource is created but fails during provisioning, marking it as tainted ensures it will be recreated.
- **Manual Changes**: If manual changes were made to a resource outside of Terraform, tainting it can force a clean state by recreating the resource.
