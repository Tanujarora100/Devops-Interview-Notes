## HTTP/0.9: The One-Line Protocol

HTTP was originally proposed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, who authored the first HTTP specification. HTTP/0.9, also known as the "One-Line Protocol," was the first version of HTTP introduced in 1991. It was a simple text-based protocol that allowed clients to request documents from servers using a single line command in the format "GET ".

## HTTP/1.0: Expanding Functionality

HTTP/1.0, officially released as RFC 1945 in 1996, expanded upon HTTP/0.9 by introducing a more robust request and response format. HTTP/1.0 added support for request and response headers, which allowed clients and servers to exchange metadata about the request and the resource being transferred. Some key headers introduced in HTTP/1.0 include Content-Type, Content-Length, Last-Modified, and Expires [1][2][3].

## HTTP/1.1: Performance and Efficiency Improvements

HTTP/1.1, first released as RFC 2068 in 1997 and later updated in RFC 2616 (1999) and RFC 7230-7235 (2014), aimed to address the performance issues present in HTTP/1.0. The most notable improvement was the introduction of persistent connections, which allowed multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection, reducing the overhead of establishing and closing connections. HTTP/1.1 also introduced features such as pipelining, chunked transfer encoding, and additional caching mechanisms [1][2][3].

## HTTP/2: A Major Leap Forward

HTTP/2, standardized as RFC 7540 in 2015, brought a fundamental shift in the way HTTP communicated over the network. Instead of using plain text, HTTP/2 utilized a binary framing layer, making it more efficient and less error-prone. HTTP/2 also introduced features like header compression, request prioritization, and server push to further improve performance [1].

## HTTP/3: Leveraging QUIC

HTTP/3, currently in development, aims to build upon the success of HTTP/2 by leveraging the QUIC protocol instead of TCP. QUIC is designed to provide lower latency and improved reliability compared to TCP. HTTP/3 is expected to provide additional performance enhancements while maintaining compatibility with the HTTP semantics established in previous versions [4].

In summary, HTTP has evolved significantly since its inception in 1989, with each version introducing new features and improvements to enhance the performance, security, and efficiency of web communication. The latest version, HTTP/3, is poised to further advance the protocol by utilizing the QUIC protocol for improved latency and reliability.
