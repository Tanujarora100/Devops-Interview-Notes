Filebeat is a lightweight log shipper that is part of the Elastic Stack, designed to efficiently collect and forward log data. 
- It is installed as an agent on servers to monitor specified log files or directories, capturing log events and sending them to either Logstash for further processing or directly to Elasticsearch for indexing.

### Key Functions of Filebeat

- **Log Monitoring**: Filebeat continuously monitors log files and directories for new log entries. 
    - When new data is detected, it reads and forwards this information in real time.

- **Data Forwarding**: Filebeat can send log data directly to Elasticsearch or route it through Logstash. 
    - When used with Logstash, Filebeat allows for additional processing, such as filtering, parsing, and transforming logs before they are indexed in Elasticsearch.

- **Backpressure Handling**: Filebeat implements a backpressure-sensitive protocol, which helps manage the flow of data. If Logstash is overwhelmed, Filebeat slows down its log reading, ensuring that data is sent at a manageable rate.

### Integration with Logstash

When Filebeat is used in conjunction with Logstash, it sends log data to Logstash's input, typically configured to listen on port 5044. 
- Logstash can then apply various filters and transformations to the incoming data before sending it to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis. 
- This integration is beneficial for complex data processing needs, allowing users to leverage Logstash's powerful capabilities for log parsing and enrichment.
