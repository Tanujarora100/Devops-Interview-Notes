# final_answer="Khali hai"
# if number < 0:
#    final_answer="Number chota hai zero se"
# elif number > 0:
#     final_answer="Number bada hai zero se"
# elif number==0:
#     final_answer="Number zero hai"
# print(final_answer)

# ODD AND EVEN NUMBER
# 1=>odd
# 2=>even 
# 3=>
# % modulo division
# 2//2=1
# 4//2=2
# Odd number=> 2 divided karoge to hamesha 1 remainder 
# even number=> 2 divide kroge to hamesha remainder 0 bachta
# 2//2=>0
# 4//2=>0
# 6//2==>0
# 8//2=0
