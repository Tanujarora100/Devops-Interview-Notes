- Function as a service
- RAM: `128MB (default) - 10 GB` (1 MB increments)
- Disk capacity (`/tmp`): `512 MB (free) - 10 GB`
- Cannot configure vCPU count directly, increase RAM to increase vCPU count
    - RAM = 1,792 MB â‡’ vCPU = 1
- Timeout: default 3s, max 15 mins (900s)
- Environment variables: `max 4 KB`
- Deployment
    - Compressed: max 50 MB
    - Uncompressed: max 250 MB (for more use `/tmp`)
## Synchronous Invocation

- The caller invokes the lambda function and waits for it to return the result
- Error handling (retries, exponential backoff, etc) must be done by the caller
- Invoking a lambda function using CLI or SDK results in synchronous invocations by default. To invoke explicitly, set `invocation-type` to `RequestResponse`
- Some services that invoke the lambda function synchronously
    - Invoked by user
        - ALB
        - API Gateway
        - CloudFront (Lambda@Edge)
        - S3 Batch
    - Invoked by service
        - Cognito
        - Step Functions
        - **SQS** (through event source mapping)
## Profiling using CodeGuru
- provide runtime performance
- Supported for `Java and Python` runtimes
- Just enable from the console
    - added as a Lambda layer
    - Required environment variables are populated
    - `AmazonCodeGuruProfilerAgentAccess` policy is attached
