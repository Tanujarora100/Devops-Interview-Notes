## AWS Elastic Load Balancer and Elastic IP Overview

### **Elastic IP**
- static ip 
- Only one network interface
- IP4 Address 
- 5 Elastic IP per region 
## ELB AND SUBNETS:
### Subnet Requirements for ELBs
1. **Public Subnets for Application Load Balancers (ALBs)**:
   - ALBs must be associated with at least **two public subnets** across different Availability Zones. 
2. **Routing Traffic**:
   - The ALB routes incoming traffic from the internet to EC2 instances located in **private subnets**. 
   - The public subnets are used for the ALB itself, while the `private subnets` house the backend instances that handle the requests.

3. **Classic Load Balancers**:
   - Classic Load Balancers can operate with a single subnet but are generally recommended to be placed in multiple subnets for redundancy and availability. 
   - They `do not enforce the same two-subnet` rule as ALBs.

### **Subnets**

- **Public Subnet**: attached internete gateway
- **Private Subnet**: uses NAT Gateway in public subnet

### **Algorithms for Load Balancers**

| Algorithm          | How It Works                                    | Benefits                                  | Drawbacks                              | Use Cases                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Round Robin**    | Cyclically distributes requests to servers      | Simple, even distribution if servers are similar | Assumes identical server capacity      | Environments with similar server performance|
| **Least Connections** | Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections | Prevents server overload, dynamic adaptation | Ignores server capacity, more complex | Varying server loads and capacities         |
| **IP Hash**        | Uses client's IP address to determine server assignment | Provides session persistence              | Can lead to uneven load distribution   | Applications requiring consistent server assignment |

### **Path-Based and Host-Based Routing**

- **Path-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on the URL path.
  - **Listener Rules**: Define path patterns to match.
  - **Target Groups**: Each path pattern is associated with a specific target group.
  - **Use Case**: Hosting multiple microservices behind a single ALB.

- **Host-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on the host header in the HTTP request.
  - **Listener Rules**: Define host conditions.
  - **Target Groups**: Each host condition is associated with a specific target group.
  - **Use Case**: Hosting multiple applications or services on different subdomains.

### **Availability Zones**

- **Definition**: Distinct locations within an AWS region engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.
- **Typical Count**: 3 to 6 AZs per region.
## **Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs. Network Load Balancer (NLB) Security Comparison**

- **Health Check Interval**: The time interval between health checks.
- **Timeout**: The` amount of time to wait for a response before marking the health check as failed`.
- **Healthy Threshold**: The number of consecutive successful health checks required before considering a target healthy.
- **Unhealthy Threshold**: The number of consecutive failed health checks required before considering a target unhealthy.

### **Example Configuration**

```hcl
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-tg"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id

  health_check {
    path                = "/health"
    interval            = 30
    timeout             = 5
    healthy_threshold   = 3
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
  }
}
```

### **Checking Health Status**

```sh
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <target-group-arn>
```
## **SSL Termination: Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

### **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

**SSL Termination Process**:
- **Layer**: ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: ALB can terminate SSL/TLS connections. This means that it decrypts incoming encrypted traffic before forwarding it to the backend instances. The process involves:
  - **Certificate Management**: You can upload SSL certificates to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM and associate them with the ALB. The ALB uses these certificates to decrypt incoming traffic.
  - **X-Forwarded-Proto Header**: ALB can add the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to requests, indicating whether the original request was HTTP or HTTPS. This is useful for applications that need to know the original protocol[1].
  - **SSL Offloading**: By offloading the SSL termination to the ALB, backend instances are relieved from the computational overhead of decrypting traffic, allowing them to focus on serving content[3].

**Security Features**:
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: ALB integrates with AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user authentication using Amazon Cognito or OIDC-compliant identity providers.
- **Advanced Routing**: Can inspect and route traffic based on content, which can be used to enforce security policies at the application level.

### **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

**SSL Termination Process**:
- **Layer**: NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
- **TLS Termination**: NLB can terminate TLS connections. This involves:
  - **Certificate Management**: Similar to ALB, you can use ACM or IAM to manage certificates. NLB uses these certificates to decrypt incoming TLS traffic.
  - **Source IP Preservation**: Unlike ALB, NLB preserves the source IP address of the client, which is forwarded to the backend instances even after TLS termination. This is beneficial for logging and security purposes.
  - **Simplified Management**: Centralized certificate management reduces the complexity of distributing certificates across multiple backend servers. Certificates are securely stored, rotated, and updated automatically by AWS.

**Security Features**:
- **DDoS Protection**: Integrated with AWS Shield for protection against DDoS attacks.
- **Static IP**: Provides a static IP address, simplifying firewall configurations.
- **Zero-day Patching**: AWS updates the NLB to respond to emerging threats, ensuring backend servers are protected.
- **Access Logs**: Detailed access logs can be enabled, providing information about TLS protocol versions, cipher suites, connection times, and more[6][8].

## **Enabling and Using Access Logs for Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**

Access logs for Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) in AWS provide detailed information about the requests sent to your load balancer. These logs can be invaluable for analyzing traffic patterns, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining security compliance. Here’s how to set up and use access logs for your ELB.

### **Types of Load Balancers and Their Logs**

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**

### **Enabling Access Logs**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
   - Open the Amazon S3 console.
   - Create a new bucket or use an existing one.
   - Ensure the bucket is in the same region as your load balancer.
   - Configure the bucket to use Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) for server-side encryption.

2. **Set Bucket Policy**
   - Grant Elastic Load Balancing permission to write to the bucket.
   - Example bucket policy:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
             "Service": "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
           },
           "Action": "s3:PutObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/AWSLogs/your-aws-account-id/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Enable Access Logs for ALB**
   - Open the Amazon EC2 console.
   - Navigate to **Load Balancers**.
   - Select your load balancer and go to the **Attributes** tab.
   - Click **Edit** and enable **Access logs**.
   - Specify the S3 bucket and optional prefix for storing the logs.
   - Save the changes.

4. **Enable Access Logs for NLB**
   - Similar steps as ALB, but ensure the NLB has a TLS listener since logs are created only for TLS requests.

5. **Enable Access Logs for CLB**
   - Open the Amazon EC2 console.
   - Navigate to **Load Balancers**.
   - Select your Classic Load Balancer.
   - Go to the **Attributes** tab, enable **Access logs**, and specify the S3 bucket.

### **Access Log File Format**

The file names of the access logs use the following format:
```
bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/aws-account-id/elasticloadbalancing/region/yyyy/mm/dd/aws-account-id_elasticloadbalancing_region_load-balancer-id_end-time_ip-address_random-string.log.gz
```
- **bucket**: Name of the S3 bucket.
- **prefix**: Optional prefix for the bucket.
- **aws-account-id**: AWS account ID.
- **region**: Region of the load balancer.
- **load-balancer-id**: Resource ID of the load balancer.
- **end-time**: Time the logging interval ended.
- **ip-address**: IP address of the load balancer node.
- **random-string**: System-generated random string.
In AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), sticky sessions (also known as **session affinity**) ensure that all requests from a particular client during a session are sent to the same backend instance. Here's how sticky sessions work in an ELB:

### 1. **Session Stickiness Concept:**
   - When a load balancer distributes traffic among multiple backend instances (EC2 instances), typically, it balances requests across these instances.
   - With sticky sessions enabled, the load balancer uses cookies to maintain a session on a specific instance. This is particularly useful for applications where session data is stored locally on the instance rather than in a shared or external store.

### 2. **Types of Cookies for Stickiness:**
   - **Application-Controlled Cookies**: Your application can set its own session cookie, which the load balancer can use to bind the session to a particular backend instance.
   - **ELB-Generated Cookies (AWSALB)**: The load balancer generates a session cookie called `AWSALB`. 
    - This is a cookie created by the load balancer to track which instance a client should be routed to for a given session.

### 3. **How it Works in ELB:**
   - **Client Request**: A client sends an HTTP request to the load balancer.
   - **Initial Load Balancing**: The load balancer forwards the request to one of the backend instances based on the load balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections).
   - **Session Cookie Creation**: The first time the client connects, the load balancer inserts the session cookie into the response, which binds the client to the specific backend instance.
   - **Subsequent Requests**: In subsequent requests, the client sends back the session cookie, and the load balancer reads it to ensure the request is forwarded to the same backend instance.

### 4. **Configuring Sticky Sessions:**
   - In the **Classic Load Balancer**:
     - Sticky sessions can be enabled by specifying a duration for the stickiness (TTL).
     - The session remains sticky until the TTL expires or the instance becomes unavailable.
   - In the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
     - Sticky sessions can also be configured, but they use the `AWSALB` cookie by default, and the duration can be specified.

### 5. **Use Cases for Sticky Sessions:**
   - Useful when session data is stored locally on instances (e.g., for login sessions or shopping carts).
   - Not recommended for applications where you want true load distribution and statelessness, like in microservice architectures, where each instance should be treated equally, regardless of past sessions.

### 6. **Considerations:**
   - **Scalability**: Sticky sessions may lead to uneven load distribution if one instance ends up handling more sessions.
   - **Failover**: If an instance fails, the client will lose its session unless session data is stored externally (e.g., in a database or distributed cache).
   - **Expiration**: Cookies have a TTL. After that, the session will no longer be sticky, and a new backend instance may be selected on the next request.

# TLS ENCRYPTION

#### 1. **SSL Termination (Offloading) Overview:**
   - **SSL Termination** refers to the process where the load balancer (ELB) handles the decryption of SSL/TLS traffic.
   - The load balancer decrypts the traffic before forwarding it to the backend instances, reducing the processing overhead on backend servers.
   - Backend instances receive unencrypted HTTP traffic, simplifying their configuration and performance.

#### 2. **Configuration of SSL Certificates and HTTPS Listeners:**
   - **Step 1**: Provision or upload an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM.
   - **Step 2**: Create an HTTPS listener on the ELB (for ALB, CLB, or NLB in TLS mode).
     - A **listener** is a process that checks for connection requests. `You configure an HTTPS listener with the SSL certificate`.
   - **Step 3**: Attach the SSL certificate to the listener, which allows the ELB to handle SSL decryption.
   - **Step 4**: Forward the decrypted HTTP traffic to the backend instances.

#### 3. **Difference Between SSL Termination and SSL Offloading:**
   - **SSL Termination**: The ELB decrypts the SSL traffic, meaning traffic between the client and the load balancer is encrypted, but traffic between the load balancer and backend servers is plain HTTP.
     - This offloads the CPU-intensive task of decrypting SSL traffic from backend servers.
   - **SSL Offloading**: A broader term that includes `SSL termination but could also mean handling SSL encryption/decryption` in a way that reduces the burden on servers (e.g., accelerating SSL performance).

#### 4. **Full End-to-End Encryption:**
   - In this scenario, SSL/TLS encryption is maintained throughout the entire request path, from the client to the load balancer and from the load balancer to the backend instances.
   - To configure end-to-end encryption:
     - **Step 1**: The load balancer uses an HTTPS listener to decrypt incoming SSL traffic.
     - **Step 2**: The load balancer re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to the backend instances over HTTPS.
     - Backend instances also need SSL certificates to handle the HTTPS traffic.
   - This ensures security even between the ELB and the backend servers.

#### 5. **Use Cases for Each Setup:**
   - **SSL Termination (Offloading)**:
     - Suitable for scenarios where performance is a concern, and you want to reduce the encryption/decryption load on backend instances.
     - Useful when internal communication is within a secure VPC, and full encryption between ELB and backend servers isn't necessary.
   - **Full End-to-End Encryption**:
     - Required when higher security standards are needed, such as compliance with strict regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS).
     - Ensures that even traffic within the VPC or internal networks is encrypted.

#### 6. **Benefits of SSL Termination:**
   - Reduces CPU load on backend instances since they do not have to handle SSL decryption.
   - Easier to manage SSL certificates centrally at the load balancer level, especially when certificates need to be renewed or updated.
   - Improves the overall throughput of the backend instances by offloading the SSL processing.

#### 7. **Considerations:**
   - **Security**: SSL termination leaves internal traffic between the load balancer and the backend unencrypted, which might be a risk if the internal network is not secure.
   - **Cert Management**: For end-to-end encryption, managing SSL certificates for both the load balancer and backend instances becomes more complex.

## 100% Encryption
### 1. **Use HTTPS Listener on the ELB:**
   - First, create an **HTTPS listener** on the ELB (either **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in TLS mode).
   - Attach an SSL certificate (which can be managed by **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**) to the ELB, so the ELB can handle HTTPS requests from clients.

### 2. **Configure HTTPS Between the ELB and EC2 Instances:**
   - To maintain encryption between the `ELB and your backend EC2 instances`, the EC2 instances must also use **HTTPS** for communication.
   - This requires installing an SSL certificate on the EC2 instances themselves, which allows them to handle encrypted HTTPS traffic.

### 3. **Steps to Enable End-to-End Encryption:**

   #### Step 1: **Set Up an HTTPS Listener on ELB**
   - In the ELB configuration, create an **HTTPS listener**.
   - Use an SSL certificate for the ELB (you can provision one through **AWS Certificate Manager**).
   
   #### Step 2: **Install SSL Certificates on EC2 Instances**
   - On each backend EC2 instance, install an SSL certificate.
   - You can generate a self-signed certificate (if internal security is sufficient) or use an official SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA).
   
   #### Step 3: **Configure EC2 Instances to Serve HTTPS**
   - Ensure that your EC2 instances are configured to listen on **port 443 (HTTPS)**.
   - Update your web server configuration (e.g., **Apache**, **Nginx**) on each EC2 instance to handle HTTPS requests and use the SSL certificate.

   #### Step 4: **Configure Target Group with HTTPS**
   - In case of an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, the target group should use **HTTPS** as the protocol for communication between the ALB and EC2 instances.
   - Ensure that the **target group** is set to forward traffic over **port 443** (HTTPS).

### 4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - After the setup, you can test by making requests to the load balancer and ensuring that:
     - Traffic between the client and the ELB is encrypted (HTTPS).
     - Traffic between the ELB and the EC2 instances is also encrypted (HTTPS).
   - Tools like `curl` and browser developer tools can help confirm that the connection is encrypted.

## CONNECTION DRAINING
#### **1. What is Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay)?**
Connection Draining (also known as **Deregistration Delay**) is a feature in AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) that allows active connections to a backend instance to **complete their processing** before the instance is deregistered or terminated. This ensures that ongoing requests are not suddenly interrupted and provides a graceful shutdown for backend instances.



#### **2. How Connection Draining Works:**
- When an instance is marked for deregistration or is about to be terminated:
  - The load balancer stops routing new traffic to the instance.
  - However, existing connections (those already being handled by the instance) are allowed to complete their execution.
  - The instance will only be fully deregistered once all the active connections are closed, or the `deregistration delay` timeout is reached.

#### **3. Configuring Connection Draining in ELB:**
   - In **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**, you can enable **Connection Draining** and set the timeout value.
   - In **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**, this feature is referred to as **Deregistration Delay** in target groups.


   ##### Steps for Configuration:
   - **Step 1**: Open the **Load Balancers** page in the **EC2 Management Console**.
   - **Step 2**: Select your ELB and go to the **Target Groups** tab.
   - **Step 3**: Select the **target group** linked to your ELB.
   - **Step 4**: Under **Attributes**, configure the **Deregistration Delay** timeout (default is usually 300 seconds, i.e., `5 minutes`).

   - For **Classic Load Balancer**:
     - Go to **Attributes** for the load balancer.
     - Enable **Connection Draining** and set a timeout value.

#### **4. Impact on User Sessions:**
   - **Improved User Experience**: 
   - **Graceful Scaling**: When Auto Scaling terminates instances, connection draining ensures that the scaling event does not disrupt ongoing requests.
   - **Timeout Limit**: 

#### **5. Use Cases for Connection Draining:**
   - **Auto Scaling Events**: When scaling in an Auto Scaling group, connection draining ensures that traffic is smoothly migrated away from instances that are being terminated.
   - **Maintenance**: During routine maintenance or instance replacement, connection draining allows for graceful instance updates without impacting ongoing sessions.
   - **Application Deployments**: In a rolling deployment scenario, connection draining helps prevent disruption when instances are being taken out of rotation for upgrades.

#### **6. Key Considerations:**
   - **Timeout Configuration**: The timeout value for connection draining should be based on the typical duration of your in-flight requests. If your application handles long-running requests, you should set a higher timeout.
   - **Effect on Auto Scaling**: Connection draining may delay Auto Scaling termination actions because instances will not terminate until all active connections are complete or the timeout expires. This could affect how quickly scaling-in happens during a high-traffic period.
   - **Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)**: If you're using sticky sessions (session affinity), connection draining helps maintain user sessions on the same backend instance while the instance is being deregistered.

#### **7. Monitoring Connection Draining:**
   - You can track metrics such as **"RequestCount"**, **"ConnectionDraining"**, and **"DeregistrationDelay"** to get insights into how often connection draining is invoked and how long it takes.
### IP Address and DNS Configuration in ELB

#### 1. **DNS Name vs. Static IPs in ELB:**
   - **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**, such as **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**, are assigned **DNS names** rather than static IP addresses.
     - Each time you launch an ELB, it generates a unique DNS name (e.g., `my-load-balancer-1234567890.region.elb.amazonaws.com`).
     - ELBs are designed to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances, dynamically changing IPs for scalability and availability.
   - **Network Load Balancers (NLB)**, which work at Layer 4, can have **static IP addresses** (Elastic IPs) assigned, making it suitable for applications that require fixed IPs.

#### 2. **Role of DNS in Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - The DNS name provided by the ELB is the **entry point** for clients accessing your application.
   - When a client requests the DNS name of the ELB, the AWS DNS service automatically resolves it to the IP addresses of the load balancer nodes.
     - These IP addresses can change over time as the ELB scales or responds to availability events.
   - DNS helps abstract the actual IP addresses of the load balancer, allowing the ELB to scale and distribute traffic across multiple Availability Zones transparently.

#### 3. **Benefits of Using DNS Names:**
   - **Dynamic Scaling**: The ELB’s DNS name is designed to dynamically resolve to the active IP addresses of the load balancer. This allows for seamless scaling of the load balancer without requiring changes to the client.
   - **High Availability**: AWS ensures that the DNS name resolves to IPs in multiple Availability Zones for redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - **Simplified Configuration**: Since clients only need to know the DNS name, the underlying infrastructure can change without requiring updates to client configuration.

### How to Integrate ELB DNS Names with Route 53 (AWS DNS Service)


##### **Step 1: Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53**
   - If you haven't already, create a **hosted zone** in Route 53 for your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
   - This will allow Route 53 to manage DNS records for your domain.
   - If your domain is registered with another provider, you can migrate DNS management to Route 53 by updating the name servers in your registrar.

##### **Step 2: Create an Alias Record for the ELB DNS Name**
   - Go to your **hosted zone** in Route 53, and create a new **Record Set**.
   - Set the **Record Type** to `A` (IPv4) or `AAAA` (IPv6), depending on your requirements.
   - In the **Alias** section, select **Yes** to create an alias record.
   - For **Alias Target**, select the **ELB** from the dropdown list (Route 53 automatically discovers the ELB DNS names).
     - You can also manually enter the DNS name of your ELB if necessary.

##### **Step 3: Define the Routing Policy**
   - Choose a **Routing Policy** based on your application’s requirements:
     - **Simple Routing**: Routes traffic to a single resource (e.g., a single ELB).
     - **Failover Routing**: Routes traffic to a primary resource (e.g., ELB) and fails over to a secondary resource in case of failure.
     - **Geolocation Routing**: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the requester.
     - **Latency-based Routing**: Routes traffic to the resource (ELB) that provides the lowest latency for the user.

##### **Step 4: Test the Configuration**
   - Once the alias record is created, the domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) will now resolve to the ELB DNS name.
   - You can test this by making DNS queries or accessing the domain from a browser. Route 53 will route traffic to the ELB via the alias record.

### Example Scenario:

Let’s say you have an ELB with the DNS name `my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com` and you own the domain `www.example.com`. To make your ELB accessible via `www.example.com`:

1. **Create a Hosted Zone** for `example.com` in Route 53.
2. **Create an Alias Record** for `www.example.com` that points to the ELB DNS name.
3. Route 53 will resolve `www.example.com` to the underlying ELB, and any traffic sent to `www.example.com` will be forwarded to the ELB.
