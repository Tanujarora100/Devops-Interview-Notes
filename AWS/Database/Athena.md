- It is a serverless interactive querying service
- We can take data stored in S3 and perform ad-hoc queries on the data paying only for the data consumed
- Athena uses a process named `Schema-on-read - table-like translation`
    - Table-like Translation: In Athena, which allows querying data stored in formats like S3, it translates these raw formats into a table-like structure at the time of query. `This means the data remains in its native form in S3, but when a query is issued, Athena dynamically applies the defined schema` to interpret the data as though it were in a traditional relational database.
    - Original data in S3 is never changed, it remains in its original form. It is translated to the predefined schema when it is read for processing
- Supported formats by Athena: XML, JSON, CSV/TSV, AVRO, PARQUET, ORC, Apache, `CloudTrail`, `VPC Flowlogs`, etc. 
- Supports standard formats of structured data, semi-structured and unstructured data
- "Tables" are defined in advance in a data catalog and data is projected through when read. It allows SQL-like queries on data without transforming source data
- Athena has no infrastructure. We don't need set up anything in advance
- Athena is ideal for situations where loading/transforming data isn't desired
- It is preferred for querying AWS logs: VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, ELB logs, cost reports, etc.
- Can query data form Glue Data Catalog and Web Server Logs
- Athena Federated Query: Athena now supports querying other data sources than S3. `Requires a data source connector (AWS Lambda)`
- Data Source Connector used is lambda.
