# AWS Batch

- Managed compute service commonly used for large scale `data analytics and processing`
- It is managed batch processing product
- Batch Processing: jobs that can run without end-user interaction, or can be scheduled to run as resources permit
- AWS Batch lets us worry about defining jobs, it will handle the underlying compute and orchestration
- AWS Batch core components:
    - Job: script, executable, docker container submitted to batch. Jobs are executed using containers in AWS. The job define the work. Jobs can depend on other jobs
    - Job Definition: metadata for a job, including IAM permissions, resource configurations, mount points, etc.
    - Job Queue: jobs are submitted to a queue, where they wait for compute environment capacity. `Queues can have a priority`
    - Compute Environment: the compute resources which do the actual work. Can be managed by `AWS or by ourselves`. We can configure the instance type, vCPU amount, spot price, or provide details on a compute environment we manage (ECS)
- Integration with other services:

## AWS Batch vs Lambda

- Lambda has a 15 minutes execution limit, for longer workflows we should use Batch
- Lambda has limited disk space in the environment, we can fix this by using EFS, but this would require the function to be run inside of a VPC
- Lambda is fully serverless with limited runtime selection
- Batch is not serverless, `it uses Docker with any runtime`
- Batch `does not have a time limit for execution`

# Managed vs Unmanaged AWS Batch

- Managed:
    - AWS Batch manages capacity based on our workload needs
    - We decide the instance type/size and if we want to use on-demand or `spot instances`
    - We can determine `our own max spot price`
    - We need to create VPC gateways for access to the resources
    - Using the managed compute environment we allow AWS the manage all the infra on our behalf, we just need to tweak some high level values
- Unmanaged:
    - We manage everything, we create the environment, we direct AWS to use that environment
    - Generally used if we have a full compute environment ready to go
    - Requires specific AMI for the EC2 instances
